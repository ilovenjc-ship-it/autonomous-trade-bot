# Whale Flow — Phase 1

**Sprint:** Session XXXVII (initial ship), Session XXXVIII (data-path pivot)
**Status:** done — RPC pivot live
**Owner:** II Agent
**Cost replaced:** TaoStats Standard tier ($50/mo, $600/yr)

## Session XXXVIII pivot — TaoStats → direct Finney RPC

The original Phase 1 implementation (commit `1df367c6`) polled
TaoStats `/api/delegation/v1` every 5 min on the free tier. The credit
pool ran dry over the first weekend of operation, leaving the panel
empty. Rather than top up a third-party budget, the data path was
swapped to **direct Substrate WebSocket subscription** against
`wss://entrypoint-finney.opentensor.ai:443` — the same chain endpoint
validators read.

| Aspect | Before (Phase 1 TaoStats) | After (Phase 1 RPC) |
|---|---|---|
| Source | TaoStats `/api/delegation/v1` HTTP poll | Finney chain WS subscribe |
| Cadence | 300 s polling | ~12 s per finalized block |
| Latency | up to 5 min | ~12 s (finalized lag) |
| Auth | `TAOSTATS_API_KEY` required | None (chain RPC is keyless) |
| Cost | TaoStats credits (free tier dry) | Free, source of truth |
| Failure mode | upstream rate limit / credit exhaustion | Finney public node unreachable (also breaks rest of chain stack) |
| Reconnect | implicit per poll | explicit exponential backoff (1 s → 60 s cap) |
| `stale_after_s` | 1200 | 120 |

**Public contract preserved exactly** — frontend `WhaleActivityPanel.tsx`
and routers/whale_flow.py required zero changes. The on-the-wire JSON
shape, all 5 endpoints (`/api/whale-flow`, `/summary`, `/{netuid}`,
`/{netuid}/summary`, `/status`), and the canonical event dict are
identical.

**Library:** `async-substrate-interface` (already a transitive dep of
`bittensor>=10`, now pinned explicitly in `requirements.txt`).

**USD pricing:** TaoStats provided historical per-event USD. The chain
emits raw rao only. We compute `amount_usd = amount_tao *
price_service.current_price()` (CoinGecko TAO/USD, refreshed every
~60 s). Negligible drift at the ~12 s block-time horizon.

**Subnet event filter scope:** `SubtensorModule.StakeAdded` and
`StakeRemoved` only — those are the canonical user-initiated whale
events. `AutoStakeAdded` (auto-restake of validator emissions, ~30+
per block) is deliberately excluded as noise.
`StakeMoved`/`StakeTransferred`/`StakeSwapped` are easy adds for
Phase 2.

## Overview

Per-subnet feed of large stake / unstake events, surfaced on the
SubnetDetail page as a right-rail panel. Mirrors the "Whale Activity"
panel that Talisman shows in their Earn → Subnet view (Mav screenshot,
2026-05-17), and adds intelligence Talisman does not: ping-pong
detection, repeat-offender flagging, and Conviction-Era owner overlay.

## Goals

1. Replace the TaoStats Standard tier value proposition ($50/mo) with a
   free integration on the **TaoStats `/api/delegation/v1` endpoint**.
2. Surface whale flow as actionable signal in the operator UI:
   - Per-subnet, last 1D / 1W / 1M
   - Net flow indicator (gross_in vs gross_out)
   - Top-N events with truncated SS58, direction, τ + USD, validator,
     time-ago
3. Make the data accessible to the chat agent (`II Agent` page) so
   "any whales loading SN1 today?" routes to a real answer.

## Non-Goals (Phase 1)

- Real-time RPC subscription. We poll every 5 min; sub-minute alerts
  are Phase 2.
- Twitter / Discord whale-watch feeds. Out of scope.
- Validator-side rollup (which validators are receiving whale flow).
  Reserved for Phase 2 once Phase 1 ships clean.

## Data Source

**Endpoint:** `GET https://api.taostats.io/api/delegation/v1`
**Auth:** `Authorization: <TAOSTATS_API_KEY>` (already in env, free tier)
**Cadence:** poll every 300s
**Filters used per call:**
- `action=all`
- `amount_min=100000000000` (= 100 τ in rao; default whale threshold)
- `order=timestamp_desc`
- `limit=200`
- (no netuid filter — single global poll, fan-out to per-subnet views)

Each event payload provides everything we need:
- `id` (dedup key)
- `block_number`, `timestamp`
- `action` ∈ {`DELEGATE`, `UNDELEGATE`}
- `nominator.ss58` (the staker / "whale")
- `delegate.ss58` (validator hotkey)
- `amount` (rao, TAO terms)
- `alpha` (rao, alpha terms)
- `usd` (pre-computed USD value at block time)
- `netuid`, `extrinsic_id`

## API Contracts

### `GET /api/whale-flow`

Query params:
- `netuid` *(int, optional)* — filter by subnet
- `window` *(`1d` | `1w` | `1m`, default `1w`)* — rolling window
- `limit` *(int, 1–200, default 50)* — events returned
- `min_tao` *(float, optional)* — override default 100 τ floor

Response:

```

## UI / UX

`WhaleActivityPanel` matches the Talisman screenshot's spatial pattern:

- **Header:** "Whale Activity" + 1D / 1W / 1M segmented toggle
- **Net flow bar:** gross_out (red) / gross_in (green) split, with τ
  totals on each end. If perfectly balanced (Talisman's screenshot
  shows 2,191 ↔ 2,191 — likely same actor splitting wallets), render a
  subtle "balanced flow" badge to flag the pattern.
- **Event rows:** `avatar | head6…tail6 | timeago` on left, `±τ amount`
  + `$usd` on right. Direction uses red `−` for UNDELEGATE, green `+`
  for DELEGATE.
- **Empty state:** "No whales active in the last {window}" with a
  threshold hint.

## Edge Cases

- **TAOSTATS_API_KEY missing** → service marks itself `configured=false`,
  panel renders a setup CTA (do not surface as red error).
- **TaoStats 429 rate-limit** → log, hold last-good cache, `stale=true`
  on next snapshot. Free-tier budget at 5-min cadence: ~288 calls/day,
  well within published limits.
- **netuid not in any event** → `events: []`, `event_count: 0`.
- **Same address in/out within seconds (ping-pong)** → both events
  surfaced; client tags pairs as `is_pingpong=true` when amounts match
  within 1% within a 60s window. Phase 1 surfaces the flag; doesn't
  hide events.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `GET /api/whale-flow?netuid=1&window=1w` returns ≥ 1 event when
  the past week saw a stake ≥ 100 τ on subnet 1.
- [ ] WhaleActivityPanel renders on SubnetDetail without scroll-jank
  on 1366×768.
- [ ] `system_health` registry shows `whale_flow` green within 5 min of
  boot.
- [ ] Free-tier API budget verified: 24h log shows ≤ 320 outbound
  TaoStats calls.
- [ ] No console errors / red squiggles in built bundle.

## Implementation Notes

- Singleton + async lock pattern, mirroring `CexListingService`.
- Disk cache path resolution mirrors `whale_service` (DATA_DIR override
  for Railway volume).
- Address truncation: `head6…tail6` (Talisman convention), full SS58
  retained in payload for chat agent / future drill-down.

## Status / Open Questions

- **Threshold default:** 100 τ. Per-subnet adaptive thresholds (top 5%
  of stake events on that subnet) tabled for Phase 2.
- **Scope:** all subnets in v1. Free-tier budget covers it.
- **Alert routing:** Phase 1 fires `WHALE_FLOW_INFLOW` /
  `WHALE_FLOW_OUTFLOW` at level INFO when a single event > 500 τ
  ($135K+) hits. CRITICAL escalation reserved for Phase 2.
